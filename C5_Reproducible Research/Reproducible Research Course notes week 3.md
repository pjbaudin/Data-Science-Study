# Reproducible Research

## Week 3 - Course Notes

### Communicating Results

Specify the level of detail

It is often useful to breakdown the results of an analysis into different levels of granularity / detail

**Hierarchy of information: Research Paper**

- title / author list
- abstract
- body / results
- supplementary materials (the gory details)
- code / data (really gory details)

**Hierarchy of information: Email presentation**

- subject line / sender info
      - can you summarize findings in one sentence?
- Email body
      - a brief introduction of the problem / context
      - suggest some options and solutions if action is needed
      - try to make answer to questions yes/no
- Attachment
- Links to supplementary materials

Different people will be interested in different level of details

### Reproducible Research - Checklist

1. Start with Good Science
      - Garbage in - garbage out
      - coherent, focused question simplifies many problems
      - working with good collaborators reinforces good practices
      - something that is interesting to you will (hopefully) motivate good habits

2. Don't do things by hand
      - Editing spreadsheets of data to "clean it up"
            - removing outliers
            - QA / QC
            - Validating
      - Editing tables or figures
      - Downloading data from a website
      - Moving data around your computer, splitting/reformating data files
      -
Things done by hand need to be precisely documented

3. Don't point and click
      - Many data processing / statistical analysis packages have graphical user interfaces
      - GUIs are convenient / intuitive but the actions you take with a GUI can be difficult for others to reproduce
      - Some GUIs produce a log file or script which includes equivalent commands, these can be saved for later examination
      - In general, be careful with data analysis software that is highly interactive; ease of use can sometimes lead to non-reproducible research
      - Other interactive software, such as text editors are usually fine
