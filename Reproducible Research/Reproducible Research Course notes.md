# Reproducible Research - Course 5

## Week 1 - Concept, Ideas and Structure

### What is reproducible research about?

Metaphor of music and instructions.
Develop the score of data analysis.

In data analysis, there is no standard for describing what is done.

Varieties of ways to communicate data analyis

### Reproducible research - Concept and Ideas

The ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence is replication of findings and conducting studies with independent:

* Investigators
* Data
* Analytical methods
* Laboratories
* Instruments

Replication is particularly important in studies that can impact broad policy or regulatory decisions.

Other scientist will cross-check and try to replicate results to confirm the findings.

** Reproducible research:**
Make analytic data and code available so that others may reproduce findings.

Validation of the data analysis.

Complex statistical methods are needed and subjected to intense scrutiny.

** Research Pipeline **

1- Measured data
2- Analytic data
3- Computational results
4- Presentation code (figures, tables, numerical summaries)
5- Article and text

Recommendations from the IOM report (omics-based tests):
* Data/metadata used to develop test should be made publicly available

* The computer code and fully specified computational procedures used for development of the candidate omics-based test should be made sustainably available

* Ideally the computer code that is released will encompass all of the steps of computational analysis, including data preprocessing steps, that have been described in this chapter. All aspects of the analysis need to be transparently reported.

** What do we need? **

* Analytic data are available
* Analytic code are available
* Documentation of code and data
* Standard means of distribution

** Who are the players? **

* Authors: want to make research reproducible

* Readers: want to reproduce

** Challenge **

* Needs a lot of effort to put data/results on the web
* Readers must download data/results individually and piece it together
* Readers may not have the same resources as Authors
* Few tool to help authors/Readers
