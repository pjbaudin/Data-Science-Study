# Datacamp - Foundations of Inference

The process of making claims about  population based on information from a sample

**Vocabulary**

- Null hypothesis (Ho): the claim that is not interesting
- Alternative hypothesis (Ha): the claim corresponding to research hypothesis

The goal is to disprove the null hypothesis.

**Randomized distribution**

Logic of inference

Example:
Phat(west) - Phat(east)

Generating a distribution of the statistic from the null population gives information about whether the observed data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis.

Many random permutations lead to randomized distribution
