# Regression Model - Week 1

## Introduction to regression and least squares

### Regression

Regression models are the workhorse of data science. They are the most well described, practical and theoretically understood models in statistics. A data scientist well versed in regression models will be able to solve an incredible array of problems.

Perhaps the key insight for regression models is that they produce highly interpretable model fits. This is unlike machine learning algorithms, which often sacrifice interpretability for improved prediction performance or automation. These are, of course, valuable attributes in their own rights. However, the benefit of simplicity, parsimony and interpretability offered by regression models (and their close generalizations) should make them a first tool of choice for any practical problem.

mu = Ybar

The least square estimate is the empirical mean
