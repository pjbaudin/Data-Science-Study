# Exploratory Data Analysis - Week 3 - Course Notes

## Hierarchical Clustering

Clustering organizes things that are close into groups.

* How do we define close?
* How do we group things?
* How do we visualize the grouping?
* How do we interpret the grouping?

Hugely important and impactful method

* An agglomerative approach
* Requires
    * A defined distance
    * A merging approach
* Produces a tree showing how close things are to each other

How do we define close?

* Garbage in -> Garbage out
* Distance or similarity
    - Continuous - Euclidean Distance
    - Continuous - Correlation similarity
    - Binary - Manhattan Distance
* Pick a distance/similarity that makes sense for your problem
